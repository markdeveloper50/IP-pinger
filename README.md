# Server Status Checker

This simple Python script uses the Tkinter GUI library to create a graphical interface for checking the status of specified servers through the `ping` command. The script allows users to input a list of IP addresses, and it continuously pings each IP in the list, displaying the response time and status (Online/Offline) in a user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included in standard Python installations)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open the script in a text editor and add the IP addresses you want to monitor to the `data` array.
3. Run the script using the command: `python script_name.py`
4. The GUI window will display the status of the specified IP addresses, updating every second.

## Generating Executable (Windows)
You can generate an executable (.exe) file from the script using [auto-py-to-exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe). Follow these steps:

1. Install `auto-py-to-exe` using the command: `pip install auto-py-to-exe`
2. Run the following command to open the GUI for `auto-py-to-exe`: `auto-py-to-exe`
3. Load the script, configure options if needed, and click "Convert .py to .exe."

The executable file will be generated in the output directory.

## Note
- The script uses threading to ping multiple IP addresses simultaneously, providing real-time updates.
- The `scrolledtext` module is utilized to handle longer output, allowing for easier reading.
- The script automatically updates the status every second.

Feel free to customize the script to suit your needs and contribute to its development. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please create an issue in the repository.
Happy pinging :)
